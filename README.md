Project Overview:

Title:
Cracking the Market Code: AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

Objective:
To develop an intelligent system that predicts future stock prices using advanced time series analysis and machine learning models, helping investors make more informed financial decisions.


---

1. Introduction:

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the high volatility and non-linear nature of financial data. This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning and statistical models, to analyze historical stock data and forecast future prices with improved accuracy.


---

2. Problem Statement:

Traditional forecasting methods often fall short in capturing complex patterns in financial data. There's a need for a robust, data-driven approach that can adapt to fluctuations and provide more reliable predictions.

3. Methodology:

Data Collection:

Historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage

Features include open, close, high, low, volume, and technical indicators


Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Normalizing/Scaling data

Creating lagged features and time windows


Models Used:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Captures sequential dependencies and temporal patterns

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Useful for linear trends and seasonal data

Facebook Prophet: Designed for time series forecasting with trend, seasonality, and holiday effects


Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)



---

4. Tools & Technologies:

Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly

Web Technologies (for deployment): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

Data Sources: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage



---

5. Results:

Predicted prices closely track real prices for major stocks (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL)

LSTM outperformed traditional models in handling volatile data

Interactive charts display historical and predicted trends clearly



---

6. Conclusion:

The project successfully demonstrates how AI can enhance stock price forecasting. Although no prediction model can guarantee 100% accuracy due to market unpredictability, these models significantly reduce error margins and provide meaningful insights for traders and analysts.

7. Future Enhancements:

Integrate sentiment analysis using news and social media data

Add reinforcement learning for adaptive trading strategies

Expand to cryptocurrency and forex prediction
